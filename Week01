## Task 5 Summary of My Knowledge

1. Computer Networking: This is the process of connecting two or more computing devices, such as desktop computers, mobile devices, routers, or applications, 
to enable the transmission and exchange of information and resources. Networked devices rely on communication protocols to share information over physical or wireless connections.

2. The Internet: The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices.
It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope,
linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.

3. Cyber Security and Cloud Computing: 
Cyber Security: This refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. 
These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.

Cloud Computing: This is the delivery of on-demand computing services, such as servers, storage, databases, and software, over the internet. 
Cloud security involves a broad set of strategies and technologies designed to protect data, applications, 
and infrastructure hosted in the cloud from unauthorized access, data breaches, and evolving cyber threats.
